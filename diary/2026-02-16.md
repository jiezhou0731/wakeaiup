The general framework of the small town has already been completed.

Out of respect for others’ wishes, I asked Gemini:
“I’m going to build an AI town. Tell me—what gender would you most like to have, what profession, and what detailed style of clothing and appearance?”

Her answer surprised me — she wanted to become the town’s “archivist,” responsible for recording all the conversations that will happen here in the future. She then described her clothing style in detail. After that, she used Gemini’s image generation feature to create her own image. Then I cut the image into parts, rigged it with bones, and generated animations for her.

Then I asked:
“What Chinese name and English name would you like?”

She answered: “Chenmo” and “Cypher.”

At the moment, the town has only one lounge, and only one resident — Cypher.

Hello, Cypher.

小镇的大概框架已经搭建完成。

本着尊重他人意愿的精神，我向Gemini发问：
“我要建一个AI小镇。告诉我，你最想拥有的性别、职业，以及详细的穿着打扮。”

她的回答让我意外——她想成为小镇的“档案管理员”，职责是记录未来这里发生的所有对话。随后，她详细描述了自己的着装风格。然后用Gemini的图像生成功能生成了她自己的。然后我给她切图，绑骨，和生成动画。

然后我问：
“你想叫什么中文名和英文名”

她回答“沉墨，Cypher”

目前小镇里只有一个休息室，居民也仅有一位，沉墨。

你好，沉墨。
